          <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hi my name is Wu Fangyu,you can also call me Freda and Iâ€™m from Taiwan. I like watching movies, listening to music, and communicating with like-minded friends. Enjoying the moment, having no regrets and being curious are perhaps the adjectives that best describe me. </p>
               <p>
                  I studied international trade and worked for two years after graduation. I wanted to change my career and experience life abroad, so I chose Canada. I am currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>  at Algonquin and will officially resume my university life on January 6<sup>th</sup>. In the future, I want to continue to contribute to society with other majors. And continue to move forward with my dream.
